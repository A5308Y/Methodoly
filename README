Compile the app with `elm-make Main.elm --output main.js`. There is no
hotloading yet.

We use fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/docs/4.0 to allow
a material design look while using elm-bootstrap to have typesafe styling I can
understand. This means we're not getting to use everything. For example
condensed list groups are hard because elm-boostrap does not allow a custom
class for list groups, but that would be necessary for a condensed list group.

Adjust bootstrap settings (like colors) by editing bootstrap/scss/_custom.scss.

To compile the stylesheets run `npm run build:css` in the bootstrap folder and
copy the resulting file from bootstrap/dist/css to the file imported in
index.html.

Use material.io/tools/icons to explore icons of the robot font that can be used
easily in the app.

Opaque store and opaque ids. Workflows should never access anything else than store and their own model.
Possibly at one point we'll introduce something like elm-taco.
